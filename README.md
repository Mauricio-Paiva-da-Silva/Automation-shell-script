# Post-installation automation
  Repository created to automate installations on Debian-based GNU / Linux distributions

---

  This repository contains 2 (two) scripts to automate the post-installation process for a GNU / Linux distribution, which is based on Debian. However, it is dedicated to installing basic tools from a programmer / developer. In the scripts there will be a session of choice between a beginner developer and a more experienced developer, so that in case of being a beginner, come with an extra tool to help. At the end of all updates, the script will ask if the user would like to update the system and restart or shut down. If you don't want to, there is a script that does the update only.

  P.S .: These are far from being good scripts, as I am starting in the shell script.
