# Post-installation automation
  Repository created to automate installations on Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions

---

  This repository contains some scripts to automate the post-installation process for a GNU/Linux distribution, which is based on Debian. It is however dedicated to installing basic tools of a programmer/developer. In the scripts there will be a session of choice between a beginner developer and a more experienced developer, so that in case of being a beginner it will come with tools to help. In addition, when finishing these installations it will give you additional installation options. At the end of all updates, the script will ask if the user would like to update the system and restart or shut down.
